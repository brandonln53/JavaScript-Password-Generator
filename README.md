# 03 JavaScript Password Generator
## University of Denver Full-Stack Web Developer Boot Camp

This homework required me to create a simple password generator with a logical JavaScript file. HTML and CSS files were already created. My job was to add the JS to the project.   
### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password  
WHEN I click the button to generate a password  
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria  
WHEN prompted for password criteria  
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password  
WHEN prompted for the length of the password  
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters  
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password  
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters  
WHEN I answer each prompt  
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected  
WHEN all prompts are answered  
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria  
WHEN the password is generated  
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page  


I look forward to continuing with this project.
